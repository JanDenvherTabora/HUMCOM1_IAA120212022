  <li>In a pan at medium heat, put oil and wait until it's well-heated before adding the garlic. Saute until golden brown.</li>
  <li>When the garlic has that nice golden brown color, put your rice in the pan. Add a pinch of turmeric powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
  <li>After the rice is mixed all the way, cover the pan, then set aside.</li>
  <li>In another pan, medium heat, put a little bit of oil, heat for 1-2 minutes before adding garlic, then your ground beef.</li>
  <li>If you see that the ground beef nearly cooked, add sugar, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Combine it nicely and let it cook for another 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan in the heat after a few minutes, then set aside.</li>
